# Digital_Image_Processing

1. Image Basics:
- know how to access pixels from an image matrix, compute a gray scale histogram and learn to equalize, compare and match histograms.
2. Filters and Edge Detection: 
3. Bayer Filter, Dithering and Geometric Operations:
- perform color image reconstruction using Bayer pattern and color reproduction using Dithering, perform image rotation, scaling, and skewing which are specializations of affine transformation, and image stitching by feature-matching algorithms.
4. Cell Segmentation:
- detecting cells in an image using blob detection techniques in Scikit-image and use watershed segmentation to find the boundaries of the cells I detected. 
5. JPEG encoding and decoding

- Digital image and video representations, file formats
- Color representations and adjustments for displaying and printing
- Introduction to image compression and coding
- A brief introduction to Deep Learning for image classification
