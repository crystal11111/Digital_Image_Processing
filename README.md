1. Image Basics:
- know how to access pixels from an image matrix, compute a gray scale histogram and learn to equalize, compare and match histograms.
3. Filters and Edge Detection: 
4. Bayer Filter, Dithering and Geometric Operations:
- perform color image reconstruction using Bayer pattern and color reproduction using Dithering, perform image rotation, scaling, and skewing which are specializations of affine transformation, and image stitching by feature-matching algorithms.
5. Cell Segmentation:
- detecting cells in an image using blob detection techniques in Scikit-image and use watershed segmentation to find the boundaries of the cells I detected.
